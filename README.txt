This project is posted mostly as a sample of my work.
The notable features are the GUI (written using Windows Forms, designed to be simplistic but user-friendly) and an optional AI opponent (using a negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning)

The file structure of the repository mirrors that of a Visual Studio project folder.

To run the program, first download the repository on a Windows computer. Then navigate to Checkers/bin/Debug and run the Checkers.exe file
